# Random Password Generator!

## A program that will create a unique, secure password at the click of a button! Users may choose a password length from 8 to 128 characters, as well as whether or not they would like to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and/or symbols. At the outset of this project, my instructor told me that this challenge would be... well.. challenging. I can tell you now that he was not exaggerating. However, through the headaches and hair pulling and frustration, I have gained a much better understanding of javascript. From 'if' statements and 'for; loops, to scoping and insight as to how the computer is reading the contents of the page; the skills I've learned will surely come in handy, later. Thanks for your consideration, and happy coding.
